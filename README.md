# White Label Football

This project is a demonstration of building white label apps using Expo. It includes separate projects for App, Server, and CMS.

## App

The App project is a React Native app built with Expo. It is a white label app that can be configured to display different content based on the configuration provided by the Server.

## Server

The Server project is a Node.js server built with Express. It provides an API for the App to fetch configuration data.

## CMS

The CMS project is a React app. It provides a web interface for managing the configuration data that the Server provides to the App.

NOTE: The server and CMS projects are very basic and are only intended to demonstrate the concept of white label apps. Do not use them in production.
